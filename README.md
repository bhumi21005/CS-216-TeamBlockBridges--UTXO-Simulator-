# CS-216---TeamBlockBridges--UTXO-Simulator


---
### Project Overview

This project is a complete simulation of the **Bitcoin UTXO (Unspent Transactions output)** model - implemented from scratch without using any Blockchain libraries. It demonstrates how bitcoin manages coins, validate transactions, prevent double spending, and confirm transactions via mining. 
This simulator is **simple, educational, and fully interactive via command-line menu** -  perfect for understanding real bitcoin mechanics.

### Learning Outcomes

 **By completing this assignment, we demonstrate:**

- **Clear understanding of the UTXO-based accounting model**

- **Correct validation of Bitcoin-like transactions**

- **Robust double-spending prevention**

- **Simulation of the full transaction lifecycle**

- **Practical insight into transaction fees and miner incentives**

- **Experience in modular system design using Python**

 ### Instructions to run the program 

 1.  **Clone or Download**: Download this repository to your local machine.

  ### Brief Explaination of our Design

  Our simulator is designed using a clean, modular structure that reflects the core architecture of Bitcoin's UTXO model.

  ### UTXO Manager
  Maintains all unspent outputs.
  It allows: 
  - Adding new UTXOs  
  - Removing spent UTXOs  
  - Checking ownership  
  - Calculating balances  

  ###  Transaction Structure  
  Each transaction contains inputs (UTXOs being spent) and outputs (new UTXOs created).  
  Every transaction is assigned a unique, auto-generated ID.

  ###  Validator  
  The validator enforces all required rules:
  - Inputs must exist in the UTXO set  
  - No duplicate inputs  
  - Input amount ≥ Output amount  
  - No negative outputs  
  - No mempool conflicts (prevents double spending)  

  ### Mempool  
  Stores valid but unconfirmed transactions.  
  Tracks UTXOs currently “reserved” by pending transactions to avoid conflicts.

  ###  Mining Logic  
  Simulates block creation:
  - Selects transactions from the mempool  
  - Removes input UTXOs  
  - Adds output UTXOs  
  - Awards miner fees  
  - Clears mined transactions from the mempool  

 ###  Overall Design Choice  
  The system is intentionally lightweight and uses only Python’s standard library.  
  There is **no networking, no cryptography, and no distributed consensus** — only the core transaction and UTXO logic required by the assignment.

  ##  Dependencies / Installation

  No external libraries are needed.  
  The simulator runs entirely on Python's built-in standard library.
